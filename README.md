### 1. OpenCV (cv2)
For video capture and image processing.  
Install it with:

```
pip install opencv-python
```
### 2. NumPy
For handling arrays and numerical operations (used for creating blank frames).
Install it with:
```
pip install numpy
```
### 3. Threading
Threading is part of the Python standard library, so there's no need to install it separately.

### 4. Setup
